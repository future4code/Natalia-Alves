    <p class="description-project">This was the first project our class had to develop to test our knowledge about Javascript.</p>
    <p>Those are the rules of the game:</br>
    </br>
        - There are two players: the user and the machine.</br>
        - The player uses a deck with several cards. The cards have a number (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J , Q, K) and a suit(Hearts (♥️), Clubs (♣️), Diamonds(♦️) e Spades(♠️)). </br>
        For example, a card from the deck is two of Clubs (2♣️). There are 52 possibilities of different cards (13 numbers and 4 suits). </br>
        - The players buys cards from the deck. When they buy a card, it can be anyone of the 52 cards, with equal probabilities. </br>
        - The cards have their value atributed according with its number (the card 4♣️ has the value of 4, and the card 9♦️ has the value 9). </br>
        The cards J, Q e K have the value of 10, and the card A has the value of 11.</br>
        - The game starts with each player (user and machine) receiving 2 cartas. The punctuation of each player is the sum of the value of their cards.</br>
        - The player with the higher punctuation wins the game.
